# AIsense - Child Development Screening

## Project Overview
AIsense is a web-based application designed to help parents assess their child's developmental progress through a quick and scientifically-backed screening process. The platform provides valuable insights into potential developmental concerns allowing parents to take proactive measures to support their child's growth effectively.

## Installation
To set up the AIsense application locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aisense-backend.git
   cd aisense-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the server**
   Start the Express server with the following command:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Database Setup**
   The application uses SQLite for data storage. A database file named `aisense.db` will be created automatically upon the first run. Ensure that your environment allows the application to create files.

5. **Access the frontend**
   Open `index.html` in your browser to access the frontend interface.

## Usage
1. Register as a new user through the signup form.
2. Log in to access the screening process.
3. Complete the screening questionnaire to receive feedback on your child's developmental progress.
4. For healthcare providers, an admin interface allows viewing of user bookings and performance data.

## Features
- User registration and authentication.
- Ability to record and analyze child development screening results.
- Admin dashboard to manage users and view bookings.
- UI built with Tailwind CSS for an appealing and responsive design.
- Multi-step forms for user interactions, with validation for input fields. 

## Dependencies
The backend of AIsense relies on the following Node.js packages:
- **express**: Web framework for building web applications.
- **sqlite3**: SQLite database library for storing user and booking information.
- **body-parser**: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies.
- **cors**: Express middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

These dependencies are specified in the `package.json` file:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "sqlite3": "^5.1.6",
    "body-parser": "^1.20.2",
    "cors": "^2.8.5"
  }
}
```
